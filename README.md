# url-shortener for rethink

 Easy and lightweight URL shortener created with JavaScript, Express, and MongoDB

#### Ready to run 

- Install dependencies with a quick "npm install" 
- Make sure Mongo is running as a service. If you're not sure how to do that, you can read more [here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)
- Start the app with npm start and open up http://localhost:5000 

#### notes 

- this app is mostly ready to deploy. the MongoDB URI is currently hardcoded in db.js. it would need to be changed to the appropriate destination and set as an environmental variable
