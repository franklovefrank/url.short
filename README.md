## movie search tool 

Created with Node.js, React, Material-UI, and The Movie Database API âœ¨


#### Run locally 
- Clone
- `npm install` in the root folder.
- `npm install` in the `client` folder 
- `node server.js` in the local folder.
- `npm run start` or `yarn start` in the `client` folder (I know this is whack)

#### thoughts

I decided to use a public database of since I don't know a million of anything, but the search engine could be easily adapted to another database. Right now, the app only searches by title. If I had more time I would add a feature to search and filter by different keys, as well as a modal display with more information for the movie the user selects.
